Machine Learning algorithms for practice

The iris_ds.py is a compilation of scikit-Learn (Python package) commands.

You can find the dataset at UCI's machine learning repo. Its called iris. The link is given below:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

The code contains various ways to:

1. Read data
2. Understand data
3. Visualize data
4. Visualize teh correlation between data features
5. Preprocessing preperation of data
6. Resampling data
7. Evaluation of algorithms with sampling methods
8. Algorithm evaluation metrics
9. Model comparison and selection of algorithm

All of this was possible because of Dr. Jason Brownlee and his brilliant website "https://machinelearningmastery.com/"
